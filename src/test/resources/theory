API development for Study Mate
1. Creation of the entities.
Entity means type
We need entity group.
Group entity:
-group name : String
-description: String
-graduationDate: String
-image: String


When backend developer finishes the APIs (web services) they must provide documentation(Instructions)

At the workplace I need to ask frontend and backend devs how to hit the backend API because as an SDET I am not
required to know very well how to perform it.

End point: address of your method (behind the url that gets triggered)  -- URL
token - you have to be authorized in order to get that information from backend


How to hit the backend APIs?
1. We need endpoint url; ==> servers (it is the url listed in swagger)
2. Type of HTTP method;


I try to hit Course getting API
https://backend.studymate.us/api/courses
HTTP method: GET . each http method has own id.
